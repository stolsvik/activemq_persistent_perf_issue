# Interesting performance wrt. NON_PERSISTENT messaging

When running ActiveMQ with default config, it uses KahaDB as backend with ```JournalDiskSyncStrategy.ALWAYS``` which
flushes to disk after every operation. This is to live up to the JMS promises of persistent messaging where operations
should actually have been stored to disk when e.g. producer.send() or session.commit() returns.

This constant flushing gives a very heavy performance impact, and one should really consider the pros and cons of using
PERIODIC instead, which is _much_ faster. It however has the bad side effect that you can lose messages in case of crash
or power loss. However, you can reduce the period from 1000 ms to e.g. 25 ms and still have very high performance, while
the number of potential number of lost messages are contained.

However, I was a bit surprised by an observation: If you run the JMS Session in Transactional mode, but also do
```producer.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT)```, one might believe that there wouldn't be a need to flush
the disk, as one has specifically told the system that "this doesn't really matter". However, the performance impact
from "Transactional, non-Persistent" is just as heavy as with non-Transactional+Persistent and Transactional+Persistent.

With non-Transactional + non-Persistent, even with ```JournalDiskSyncStrategy.ALWAYS```, the speed is blazing.

It thus seems like a flush is done _even though the message was specifically set to NON_PERSISTENT_ - it is difficult
to understand why this would be needed.

One might argue, well don't use Transactional then. But Transactional also brings another feature, whereby you may
receive a message, and send a message, and have these two operations inside a transactional boundary. This aspect of
Transactional is valuable even if though the messages are non-Persistent. And the broker evidently handles this logic
already even without persistence, since if you say ```BrokerService.setPersistent(false)``` and thus turn off the entire
storage of the broker, it still handles this aspect of Transactional messaging.

It would have been valuable to be able to "selectively" turn off this pretty massive hit of flushing to disk if the
messages inside the Transaction was non-Persistent.

Note: The Java class in this repo uses an in-vm broker, with the "vm://" connection. However, this situation was first
observed with a remote broker, so the effects of interest are the same over TCP or over VM.

## Two different tests wrt. where PERSISTENT is set:

When setting DeliveryMode (PERSISTENT vs. NON_PERSISTENT) on the jmsProducer
(```producer.setDeliveryMode(deliveryMode)```):

```
Each test is time for sending and in case of 'Transactional', committing, [1000] messages

no store, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4.26321216] ms
no store, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [26.784713] ms
no store, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [32.404009] ms
no store, Transactional, Persistent:   [46.314925] ms

ALWAYS, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [3.98337124] ms  <-- (This is great, avoiding the hit.)
ALWAYS, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [4235.887625] ms
ALWAYS, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4040.549101] ms     <-- This one is curious and unfortunate!
ALWAYS, Transactional, Persistent:   [3902.525469] ms

PERIODIC, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [3.85038125] ms
PERIODIC, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [78.012904] ms
PERIODIC, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [39.030052] ms
PERIODIC, Transactional, Persistent:   [94.339609] ms

```

An alternative wrt. when to set the DeliveryMode (PERSISTENT vs. NON_PERSISTENT) on the actual send of the
message (```producer.send(msg, deliveryMode, pri, ttl)```):

```
Each test is time for sending and in case of 'Transactional', committing, [1000] messages
no store, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4.36516976] ms
no store, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [27.665534] ms
no store, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [29.056998] ms
no store, Transactional, Persistent:   [30.520276] ms

ALWAYS, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4.41806886] ms  <-- (This is great, avoiding the hit.)
ALWAYS, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [4107.414315] ms
ALWAYS, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4118.322262] ms     <-- This one is curious and unfortunate!
ALWAYS, Transactional, Persistent:   [4143.173852] ms

PERIODIC, non-Transactional, non-Persistent:   [4.453423] ms
PERIODIC, non-Transactional, Persistent:   [58.694872] ms
PERIODIC, Transactional, non-Persistent:   [28.286106] ms
PERIODIC, Transactional, Persistent:   [64.690608] ms
```
